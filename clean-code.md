# Clean Code

- In general, I believe that comments are unnecessary, we developers use comments as an excuse for not properly making our code understandable.
- The next three poins are deeply realted with "Single responsability principel"
- Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.
- Uncle Bob -> "One reason to change" -> If the code inside that function can change for different reasons, then it is doing more than one thing.
- The reason we write functions is to decompose a larger concept into a set of smaller steps.
