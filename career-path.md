# Career path:
    
## Spotify:

        We agreed on a few principles early on:

        -   This would not be a “ladder”, with an up-or-out mentality. We wanted to support people who wished to maintain their current level of responsibility.
        -   The basis for advancement was a demonstration of behaviors and not achievements. We wanted our framework to be a true model of professional development. It should be about who you are, and not about what you’ve done. In a failure-safe environment like Spotify, we didn’t want to penalize people for taking big chances.
        -   We wanted to support the changing of roles without punishing people for developing themselves. In other career ladders we’d seen, the role becomes a silo. Switching roles could mean a literal demotion since the requirements of a level are  tied to specific areas of achievement in a specific role.
        -   We wanted this framework to reflect our team-oriented and autonomy-driven culture. Teamwork is critical to our way of working and we wanted to make sure that this was part of personal development.
        -   We wanted to support both generalists and specialists. Many folks at Spotify move around the organization to develop a breadth of skills, while others like to get especially deep in specific technology areas. We wanted to support both of these types of people.
        -   We believed that career progression is marked by the impact you have on progressively larger areas of the organization, your sphere of influence.

        The four steps of career development at Spotify that we decided on were:

        -   Individual – at this level, you are new to working and are figuring out how to be productive and contributing member of the company.
        -   Squad / Chapter (these are the teams that people primarily belong to) – you are now a contributing member of a team and are a resource for the people you work with every day.
        -   Tribe / Guild (these are the larger teams organizationally or functionality that people are part of) – now you are a resource beyond your immediate team. Either because you have depth in a technology (and help others or other teams around that technology); because you are skilled at solving difficult problems that span teams; or because you can be counted on to lead other developers in your tribe to solve large cross-squad problems.
        -   Technology / Company (the highest levels of the organization) – The developers at this level are resources for the entire company based on their technical and leadership skills and are expected to spend a significant amount of their time working across the organization.
